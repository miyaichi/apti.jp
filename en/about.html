            <section class="about-intro">
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>We are launching the <strong>Advertisers and Publishers Transparency Initiative (APTI)</strong>, a general incorporated association aimed at improving transparency and health in internet advertising, where advertisers and publishers support each other while deepening their own practices.</p>
                
                <p>Members are nicknamed <strong>"schain-ers"</strong>. This name is inspired by OpenRTB's SupplyChain Object (schain), representing practitioners who support the legitimacy and reliability of advertising transactions.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="about-background">
                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>As automated advertising trading becomes mainstream, technical initiatives such as ads.txt, sellers.json, and SupplyChain Object (schain) are advancing.</p>
                
                <p>However, challenges remain at the operational level:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>ads.txt description errors and neglect</li>
                    <li>Inconsistencies with sellers.json and outdated information</li>
                    <li>Information gaps between publishers and advertisers</li>
                    <li>Difficulty for advertisers to identify appropriate placement destinations and trusted partners</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Solving these issues requires practice and dialogue from both advertisers and publishers.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="about-purpose">
                <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
                <p>APTI is a platform to support advertisers and publishers working together on equal footing to build a transparent advertising supply chain. We also welcome technology providers, agencies, and third-party organizations to participate in a supportive capacity.</p>
                
                <p>Through our activities, we will advance practices centered on the following three pillars.</p>
